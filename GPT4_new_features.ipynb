A teacher is standing beside the board, appearing to instruct or assist a student standing next to her. Throughout the room, there are other students seated at blue desks, some are writing in notebooks and others seem to be paying attention to the teacher. The classroom looks well-lit with natural light coming in from the windows, and there is a variety of educational posters and notes pinned to the walls. A world globe is sitting on a desk near the front, suggesting that the subject matter taught in this classroom could include geography as well as mathematics. The clock on the wall shows it is about 10:10. The scene captures an educational environment focused on learning and concentration.\n"
